# ALR

ALR is a script that uses 'nasm' to Assemble, 'ld' to Link and './' to Run (hence the ALR) all in one command  
It accepts x86-64 assembly files written for macs specifically (hence the mac)  
This program runs as a terminal command and uses python  
To install, run the installation script from terminal
If that fails, follow the manual installation instructions in INSTALLATION.md

## Usage

To use macALR, type in `macALR <path/to/file.extension or file.extension>`  
Note that you have to include the extension _but_ it does not matter what it is (.asm or .s)  
To check macALR's version, type in `macALR -v`  
To access the help page, type in `macALR -h`  
macALR has no other options or arguments
